# linkitz

A simple multi-purpose link website.

This is not a link shortener, but a way to customise your shortcuts. Specially made for my Opera GX.

## How to use

```https
https://linkitz.web.app/?thumb=___&image=___&redirect=___&time=___
```

Fill in the blanks with your desired parameters.

| `redirect=` | Where should you be redirected?                                                                              |
