# linkitz

A simple multi-purpose link website.

This is not a link shortener, but a way to customise your shortcuts, specifically Opera GX. Or you can just customise your browser experience by adding an image while browsing.

## How to use

We don't make a new page for every single link. Instead we use URL parameters that you can fill in when saving your shortcut.

```https
https://linkitz.web.app/l?params
```

The blanks are where you can input some data to customise your experience! If you have a general idea of how to use them, here's a table showing what each parameter defines:

| Parameter   | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `thumb=`    | This will be hidden, but available in the thumbnail options in Opera. To get an image link, upload to [Imgur](https://imgur.com). |
| `redirect=` | Where should you be redirected?                              |
| `delay=`    | This should be in milliseconds (seconds + 000).              |
| `title=` | The title displayed for the redirect link. |
| `favicon=` | The favicon displayed for the redirect link. To get an image link, upload to [Imgur](https://imgur.com). |

Once you fill in all of these (and turn them into shortcuts), you can start using your shortcuts as normal!

Note that to use the thumbnail, you will have to click on the heart icon and select an image. You may have to refresh a couple of times.

If you don't know what to do, go [here](https://ipt0t15yybc.typeform.com/to/Yz0az0d8) for a step-by-step form. You can just copy your new link.

## Bookmark it

If you don't know how to create a bookmark, follow these instructions.

1. Go to the desired website. We'll be using Google.
2. Click on the heart icon in the upper-right corner.

3. Use the arrow keys to choose a thumbnail.

    If the thumbnail you expected isn't appearing, try refreshing and deleting the bookmark. Do this a couple of times. If it's still not appearing, it may not exist.
4. Your bookmark should now be in your Speed Dial (or in a bookmark folder)

The main purpose of linkitz is to help you customise your bookmarks without having to do some file-rummaging and code-editing. Instead, you can just use an alternative link.

Please note that it may take a couple of seconds for you to pick the right thumbnail, which is why you'll need a redirect delay.
